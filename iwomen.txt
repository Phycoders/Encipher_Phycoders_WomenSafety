<h2 style="font-family: impact;">Women Life in India at Glance</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\shikh\Downloads/women9.jpg" style="float:right;width: 500px;height: 250px;">
<p style="font-family: lucida;">The status of women in ancient India was quite high esteemed however it got deteriorated with the passage of time and mentality of people towards women. Slowly the practice of polygamy, sati pratha, dowry system, female infanticide, etc became dominated and gave rise to the male dominated country. Great Indian leaders had worked a lot to again raise the status of women in the Indian society. Because of their hard work bad practices against women in the Indian society have been banned to a great extent. Government of India has implemented various effective laws regarding safety and empowerment of the women. In the Panchayati Raj system around 33% of the seats are reserved for women thus women are being more conscious and come forward to fight for their rights.</p>
<p style="font-family: impact;font-size: 25px;">Women in Free India</p>
<p class="my">Gender equality</p>
<p>	Women today are eager to take up professions and work. Thus, they enjoy equal respect and dignity in the family. Women in free India also enjoy equal pay for equal work in comparison to men. Also, there are provisions of maternity leave for them. Furthermore, females are provided equality of opportunity under Article 16 of the Constitution of India.</p>

<p class="my">Educational Status</p>
<p>The girls in urban areas are almost at par in education with the boys. But there is a less educated female population in rural areas. This has also affected the social and economic development of rural India. The poor (hygienic facilities) facilities at school and lack of female staff have affected education. Kerala and Mizoram have a universal literacy rate.</p>

<p class="my">Women and Politics</p>
<p>The maximum figure of female politicians in the world is from India. Women have occupied significant positions i.e. of President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Lok Sabha and other high offices. “Indira Gandhi”, is the first female who held the office of the Prime Minister for 15 years.</p>

<p class="my">Evils Against Women</p>
<p>The violence against women in India includes kitchen fires for want of dowry, sexual assaults, cases of rape, prostitution, throwing of acid. Also, evils of child marriages are also widespread even today. Female infanticide, indecent behavior, and honor killings add to the misery of the women. Also, sex-selective abortion is a deep-rooted evil leading to inequality in sex ratio.</p>

<p class="my">Conclusion</p>
<p>There has been a steady transformation in the status of the women in comparison to earlier periods. Women of today take part completely in areas such as politics, status, military sectors, economic, service, and technology sectors. Moreover, they have contributed wholly in sports too. Thus, they have occupied a dignified position in family and society.</p>


<h5 style="font-family: varadana;font-size: 25px;">How tecchnology helped towards women safety</h5>
<p class="para">
It is broadly accepted that digital media and the internet can provide new forms of communication and engagement for women that make networking easier, increase their social capital and facilitate the creation/growth of women’s movements. Technology can also be used to mitigate gender-based violence and improve women’s safety in a number of ways:</p>
<p class="para">
Electronic monitoring systems are allowing violence-prone areas to be identified
Short Message Service (SMS) alert systems can inform advocates of abuse
Information sharing sites and social networking service (SNS) and SMS based support groups are all potential avenues where technology can support survivors of violence.
However, in many contexts barriers hinder women and girls from accessing digital tools. Women face greater constraints than men in a number of areas:</p>

<p class="para">Access and use of ICTs. Research has demonstrated that there is no correlation between the saturation of ICTs in a country and women’s access to those ICTs.</p>
<p class="para">Usability and literacy. Access to education continues to be a greater barrier for women than men; an estimated two thirds of the world’s illiterate are women.</p>
<p class="para">Development and design. Much of the content on the Internet has not been developed to address the needs of women and girls; nor is it available in enough different languages.</p>
<p class="para">Much of the ‘success’ attributed to digital tools that have improved women’s safety and access to domestic and family violence support services is anecdotal. It requires further interrogation and triangulation with other research.</p>

<p class="para">However, some programme features emerge as common across case studies. These include:</p>

<p class="para">Integrated and cross-platform approaches. The use of digital tools works best when specialist support services are directly involved in the design, provision of information or facilitation of online discussion.
Engagement with specialist local partners (as well as national partners) by making campaign materials and information free or low cost.
Linked online and offline activities, for example using digital support services to connect women who are vulnerable to, or experiencing violence, with counsellors or support staff.
Assessment of which medium is most appropriate to which target audience</p> 
<h6 style="font-size: 25px;font-family: varadana;">Government 1090 Initiative </h6>
<img src="C:\Users\shikh\Downloads/1090ini.jpg" style="width: 500px; float: left;">
<p class="para">It is common experience that the social evil of eve- teasing is often ignored in our society. The orthodox views about gender relations, poor institutional support to victims and lack of self confidence amongst women are some of the key reasons as to why eve-teasing continues to haunt women in public as well as private spaces.</p>

<p class="para">Eve teasing, when left unchecked, emboldens criminality in the society and leads to creating greater sense of impunity amongst perpetrators. Many a times, such mind set translates into crimes against women in worse form such as street crimes, domestic violence and other forms of gender based violence. There is also awareness of the fact that women hesitate to approach, pre-dominantly male police force, especially about sensitive matter such as eve teasing. Girls also don’t come forward to report such matters as they are reluctant to make their identity public and face either social or familial condemnation or due to fear of retribution.</p>

<p class="para">The UP Police established a 24@7 Contact Center in Lucknow, called the WPL 1090 with the aim to provide opportunity to girls in UP to freely register complaints of eve-teasing and set up an innovative ICT based application to process and redress their complaints.</p>

<p class="para">The complaints could broadly be classified into following four categories:<p>

<p class="para">Eve-teasing through phone</p>
<p class="para">Eve-teasing through social media, like facebook, etc.</p>
<p class="para">Stalking</p>
<p class="para">Hotspots of eve-teasing closer to places where girls normally go to such as market places, colleges etc.</p>
<p class="para">The Contact Centre is located in the heart of Lucknow and is manned by women as well as men police force.</p>
